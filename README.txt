This is the source code of Bugale N-Body Simulator version 0.0.4 (Beta 0.4).

This project simulates the behavior, dynamics, and motion of a group of celestial objects.

Given N point masses in a three-dimensional space, it's present positions and velocities, and
supposing that the force of attraction experienced between each pair of particles is Newtonian, the project approximately predicts it's positions and velocities at a future moment of time.

This project is using either a modified Euler, a second order numerical differential
equations integration, or Hermite, a fourth order one.

The project can visualize the simulation, and create a graphic real-time output using GLUT,
and also have an option for textual output and archiving.

Bugale N-Body Data Editor provides a graphic user interface for creating and editing the
settings and body data files of Bugale N-Body Simulator. It can be found on SourceForge.
