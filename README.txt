This is the source code of Bugale N-Body Simulator version 0.2.3 (Beta 2.3).

This project simulates the behavior, dynamics, and motion of a group of celestial objects.

Given N point masses in a three-dimensional space, it's present positions and velocities, and
supposing that the force of attraction experienced between each pair of particles is Newtonian, the project approximately predicts it's positions and velocities at a future moment of time.

The project can visualize the simulation, and create a graphic real-time output using FreeGLUT,
and also have an option for textual output and archiving.

Bugale N-Body Data Editor provides a graphic user interface for creating and editing the
settings and body data files of Bugale N-Body Simulator. It can be found on SourceForge.

What's new in this release:
*Fixed many bugs
*Enlarged the console to see all of the information
*Source Code: Migrated to VS11 Beta (still using v100 compiler and linker)
*Source Code: Added the structures for CUDA calculation - will be usable soon
